### Dataset Info
The dataset used for machine learning and statistical exploration contains over 21,000 records of practice problems, each associated with a student username, problem topic, and grade level. 
Entries have timestamps marking the time of problem submission and quiz submission, if the problem was completed as part of a quiz. Other features included in the dataset describe the relevant problem and student 
performance, such as number of total problems in the quiz, percent correct, and mastery status. Data loading and feature engineering is contained in the Jupyter Notebook ML Data Loading, Cleaning, Preprocessing.
